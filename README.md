# GreaterSTL_School_Analysis
An analysis of discipline issued in school districts around Greater St. Louis City and Counties.

This exploratory analysis investigated the discipline that occurred in 2015 at four Greater St. Louis school districts: St. Louis City, Ferguson-Florissant R-II, Parkway C-2, and Rockwood R-VI. 

These datasets were specifically chosen because of the contrast in student demographic that occurs in the schools. There were notable associations between the demographics and the proportions of students disciplined. 

Unfortunately, due to the collection methods of this data, some results are inflated. This is specifcally true in the discipline categories that include multiple disciplines. Individual students are counted multiple times if they have multiple infractions. The recommendation of this analyst would be to try to maintain rows that include single-instances instead of total counts. This would help to reduce the inflation that exists and would result in more accurate analysis.
